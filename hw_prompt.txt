Using what we've learned in class, 
it's time to hook up our database to our Flask app!
Create a new instance in elephantsql, 
instantiate a new db, and update routes for 
AT LEAST one resource that now reflects persistent 
data!  Please include your access URL as a private 
comment on this assignment when you submit the link 
to your github repository.

For a challenge: Make all routes in your app 
work happily with your DB!
